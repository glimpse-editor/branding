# Glimpse Branding

Branding assets and guidelines for Glimpse

### Logo Guidelines

* Assets from the `logo` directory should generally be preferred. The `icon` directory only contains pixel-hinted versions of the logo for common application icon sizes.

* `logo_hex` or `logo_hex_full` should be used in most cases, but `logo_hex_invert` or `logo_hex_full_invert` can be used if the content behind the logo is too dark for the hexagon shape to be clearly visible. 

* `logo_basic` should be used in places where the logo might be cropped in a way that will interfere with the hexagon shape. For example this would be better suited for social media profile pictures, which usually get cropped into circles.
